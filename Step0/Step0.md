## Step 0.  Setup

### Downloading DrawFBP

We will start by installing DrawFBP, the FBP diagramming tool.  Go to https://github.com/jpaulm/drawfbp , and obtain the DrawFBP jar file from the latest release in DrawFBP/Releases, and store the jar file on your desktop.  

Alternatively, you can do a search for `DrawFBP` on Maven.  

Make sure you have Java installed, by issuing

       java -version
       
from the command line.

Either way, to run the tool, just double click on the jar file.

Alternativly, you can enter the command

       java -jar DrawFBP-[all-]x.y.z.jar
       
from the command line (you need `all-` if it came from Releases, and not if it came from Maven).
