# Tutorial on Flow-Based Programming (Filter File application)

This tutorial introduces the reader to the concepts of Flow-Based Programming, by means of diagrams built using DrawFBP, and generating running Java code, using precoded components, and (late) user-written components.


## Step 1.  Draw high level diagram of app to display contents of file. 

Here is a possible diagram:

In this step, you should install DrawFBP (https://github.com/jpaulm/drawfbp ), and draw this diagram.

Save it in a work directory of your choice.  If you open it using Wordpad, it should look like the file you get when you click on [this link](docs/Step1.drw).

Of course, if you have trouble drawing the diagram, you can simply copy the `.drw` file, and open this file under DrawFBP.

Now at this point, you can simply assign real kive components to the blocks in the diagrams (plus IIPs and port names), and you will basically have a running program.  However, I am going to assume that you want to add filter function between the two processes, so that is what we will do in Step2.

## Step2. Add a filter function
