# Tutorial on Flow-Based Programming (Filter File application)

This tutorial introduces the reader to the concepts of Flow-Based Programming, by means of diagrams built using DrawFBP, and generating running Java code, using precoded components, and (late) user-written components.


## Step 1.  Draw high level diagram of app to display contents of file. 

Here is a possible diagram:

In this step, you should install DrawFBP (https://github.com/jpaulm/drawfbp ), and draw this diagram.

Save it in a work directory of your choice.  If you open it using Wordpad, it should look like the file you get when you click on [this link](docs/Step1.drw).

Of course, if you have trouble drawing the diagram, you can simply copy the `.drw` file, and open this file under DrawFBP.
