# Tutorial on Flow-Based Programming (Filter File application)

Filter File with [DrawFBP](https://github.com/jpaulm/drawfbp): use a network of flow-based components to display selected records from files.

For more about Flow-Based Programming (FBP) please see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow-based_programming and http://www.jpaulmorrison.com/fbp/ .  

This tutorial is repeatable, so that concepts can be shared with others, or reinforced and clarified in future, perhaps on a different platform.  FBP, as demonstrated here, is fully asynchronous, and uses a "conveyor belt" analogy, rather than being procedural like a number of other systems which also use the term "Flow-Based Programming".  

Using DrawFBP, we design and build a network of components from the JavaFBP library (jar file), then compile and run in a Windows or Unix environment.
