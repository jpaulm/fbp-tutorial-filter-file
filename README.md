# Tutorial on Flow-Based Programming (Filter File application)

Filter File with DrawFBP: use a network of flow-based components to display selected records from files.

For more about flow-based programming (FBP) please see https://github.com/flowbased/flowbased.org/wiki.

This tutorial is repeatable, so that concepts can be shared with others, or reinforced and clarified in future, perhaps on a different platform.

Using DrawFBP, we design and build a network of components from the JavaFBP library (jar file), then compile and run in a Windows or Unix environment.
